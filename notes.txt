finch can't handle gzipped files or the larger database: refseq_sketches_31_10000.sk.gz

finch dist tests/test_R1.fastq db/refseq_sketches_21_1000.sk > test

this didn't yield correct results, will try concat both fastq files, then sketch and run

this worked perfectly: cat tests/test_R* | 
finch sketch -o testfile.sk - && 
finch dist testfile.sk db/refseq_sketches_21_1000.sk > test

this works even better: finch dist tests/test_R1.fastq.gz.sk db/refseq_sketches_21_1000.sk > test
